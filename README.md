A binary classification model using BERT was built to organize news articles from the Huffinton Post into two categories: (0) articles not about healthy living and wellness and (1) articles about healthy living and wellness. The project was completed as part of a class assignment for a class on use of natural langauge processing (NLP) in advertising.
